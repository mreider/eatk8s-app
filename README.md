## A little K8s test app

I wrote this little app to run tests on Kubernetes. While I love the hipster and sock shops, they are big and complicated, and I just wanted something simpler.

- Simple code base
- Runs on the JVM in JRuby (best to instrument)
- Microservices for transaction tracing
- Front end UX to increase memory and CPU load
